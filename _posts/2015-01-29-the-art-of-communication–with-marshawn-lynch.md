### What can an NFL running back who doesn’t really like to talk teach you about reaching people?

# Quite a lot, actually.
<br/>

This is very strange considering that the guarded and rebellious Lynch, a key offensive player for the defending Super Bowl champions Seattle Seahawks (the favorite team of our developer Eric) was fined $150,000 between 2013 and 2014 for refusing to talk to the media at all.

Having worked in sports and been part of innumerable post-game press scrums, I could sympathise with Lynch. On the one hand, you have a locker room full of tired athletes who have very little to gain from speaking with outsiders, and a gaggle of reporters looking for a juicy sound bite to stir up controversy and drive clicks on social media. Usually, it’s a no-win situation for the players, so most end up parroting the blandest truisms like *“we worked hard today” (if win)* or *“we need to work harder” (if loss)*; talking without saying anything.

Starting December 2014, Lynch began to take another approach, answering every single question from journalists with the same sentence.

#####Then, something amazing happened. Watch (and listen) for yourself:

*Yeah*

*I'm thankful*

*I'm here so I won't get fined*

*You know why I'm here*

## Repetition is a powerful thing, and only 7% of communication is the words coming out of one’s mouth.

By embracing the first idea and taking the second out of the equation, Marshawn Lynch is actually managing to convey his state of mind in a much more effective way. Once you see the pattern and understand that the words he says don’t matter, you can start understanding and even appreciating him as a human being.

In consistency, we find depth.

I’ll be on the ice for a hockey game this Sunday afternoon, but I know who I’ll be rooting for.
