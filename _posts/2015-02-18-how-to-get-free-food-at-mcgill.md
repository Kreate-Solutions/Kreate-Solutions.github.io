Earlier this week, members of our team were on the McGill campus to spread the word about the [new Arts Undergraduates Society app](http://ausapp.ca/).

While table-ing in the lobby of the Leacock building between noon and 2PM on Monday, we realized that university students really, really like cheap food. Which is mind-blowing only if you’ve never been 20 and broke, I guess.

As it turned out, students from the Sociology department were selling $1 samosas (yummy) and $2 cinnamon churros (2x as yummy) at the adjacent table.

This produced a literal feeding frenzy, with lines almost backing up out the door at times. It made it really easy for us to go up and down the line to hand out free AUS bookmarks and tell people to download the new AUS Today app.

Since we know that food always tastes better when you get a good deal on it, we’ve already partnered with Subway, Yeh! Yogurt And Pita Pit to include exclusive coupons in the AUS Today app. You’ll be able to save money at places you like already.

It’s super simple – download the AUS Today app, find the coupon you want in the “News” section, click on the little bookmark to “Save” the coupon, and then just show to it the cashier at participating restaurants, who will redeem it and delete it off of your phone. Easy.

*P.S.*: We will also be giving away some free food on the McGill campus **TODAY**.
