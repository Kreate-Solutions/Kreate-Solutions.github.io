## With the new version of the Kreate software deep in its development stage, we’ve recently added some new members to the team.

From a professional point of view, Jeff is an experienced front end dev who has worked on cool projects such as Yo (that wacky app which does nothing but sent “Yo” to people on your friends list) in San Francisco, Oakland, Toronto and Montreal.
Beyond his technical abilities, Jeff is also a kind, mellow and open soul; a strict vegetarian with whom you can discuss almost any topic under the sun.

On a cold Tuesday afternoon, Jeff shared with me the questionable things he has witnessed as man of mixed races in the Bay Area and also revealed that discrimination isn’t just an American phenomenon. He was once on holiday in Jamaica with his mother’s family, who is from the island. Out for a walk on a warm summer day, he decided to take a break and lie down in a grassy field. An elderly black woman walking by took one look at Jeff, turned to her friends and pronounced: “White man will sleep anywhere.” 
Jeff shared the story with a chuckle. He wasn’t going to let the comment get to him, and the absurdity of it all made the whole thing somewhat less offensive.

Here is a short story which happened recently:
One morning, Jeff showed up to the office looking a little verklempt and totally unlike his usual self.
“What’s the matter,” I inquired.

“Have you ever been to the greenhouse at Concordia University?” he asked. I nodded to the affirmative.

As Jeff explained, in his first week back in Montreal after living on the West Coast, he saw a magnificent plant in the windowsill of a store. He snapped a picture using his phone and asked all his friends on Facebook whether they knew what it was. No one did.
Jeff continued to obsess about the unknown plant until one day he walked into an upscale flower shop and showed the picture to the girl at the counter.

“Do you know what this is?”

“Yes, this is a Bird of Paradise.” She responded

“Do you have one here?”

“No, you’d have to wait until next spring.”*

But now, to Jeff’s delight, there it was in the Concordia Greenhouse seasonal plant sale. Nearly six feet tall, lush green leaves; perfection.

Standing at the front of the line after having waited since the early morning, Jeff rushed to the plant, picked it up and was ready to pay when the employee at the sale asked him if he would like to leave it there for a few days so that it could be sprayed for bugs. Jeff happily obliged and left the building with the promise that his Bird of Paradise would be ready by the end of the week.
Three days later, Jeff received an email from the employee stating that his plant had actually already been reserved for someone else and that the sale was never supposed to have gone through. 

This made Jeff furious, as he knew that the sale was first-come, first-served. They had no right to keep his plant.

“Maybe his friend wanted it or something,” Jeff sighed.

“So what are you going to do?”

“Well, first I asked him how much he wanted for the plant and told him I’ll pay more,” Jeff quipped. “That didn’t work.”

“Your first instinct was to try to bribe the guy? That’s a bit extreme,” I chuckled. Though, to be fair, I wasn’t emotionally invested in this whole ordeal. “What now?”

“I tried emailing the guy a few times but he kept brushing it off and saying that there’s nothing he can do. How can I persuade him to give me the plant?”

“Sometimes there’s a limit on what reasoning with someone over email can do. Where’s the plant now?”

“Still back at the Greenhouse, I guess.”

“Do you still have your receipt?”

“Yeah.”

“Then just go back and grab the plant. Just take it. It’s yours. If you need some muscle to fight the guy off, I’ll come with.”

Jeff smiled. A few minutes later, he was on his way back downtown.

As it turned out, Jeff didn’t need me to beat anyone up for him. After lunchtime, he emerged from the door with his Bird of Paradise. It now looks over him as he codes.

Not all problems have a technological solution. Just because we can reach nearly anyone with our smartphone, doesn’t mean it’ll be enough. As we discovered, sometimes you just need to get up, move your feet, and do it the old-fashioned way.
