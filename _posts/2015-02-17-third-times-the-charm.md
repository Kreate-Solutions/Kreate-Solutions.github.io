## How the first two versions of our app failed to deliver.  

---

I feel like I owe you all this. 

Sure, we all like to talk about our successes rather than our mistakes. I’ll be the first to admit that every time I hear the words “looks like your business is going well” I feel this warm and tingling sensation all over my body. I am not exaggerating.

But what about when things go the opposite way? When the product you envisioned ended up making the problem you were trying to solve worse, you can’t help but question everything about yourself and what you stand for. 

The problem we are trying to solve at Kreate is very simple: How do we get people to care about the stuff that matters? To us, a well-functioning civil society requires a well-informed audience, and university campuses are our ground zero.

Brace yourselves, this is a story of what went wrong:

# V1
**Release Date**: September 2, 2013

**Objective**: Develop a portal where students can check out announcements and events from the Arts Undergraduate Society. 

**How It Worked**: App admin enters content into the app through a Content Management System. Each piece of content can be tagged according to a category of users. (i.e. First Year / Second Year / Third Year)

**What Happened**: The App was empty 99% of the time. The app administrators never filled the app with any content, thus the app was completely useless to the users. This is our fault and not the fault of our clients. Student executives are incredibly busy already as an average VP Comm is required to manage at least 4-5 communication channels from Facebook to emails and we added another one onto their workload. Our product didn’t make their lives any easier.

We built a car that no one drove.

# V2 
**Release Date**: September 2, 2014

Taking into account the problems we faced, we added in these features:

**Automatic Integration of Social Media Content**: Our clients could sync their Facebook, Twitter & Instagram posts into the app automatically. (Limited to 1 Facebook, 1 Twitter, 1 Instagram page per app.)

**Visual Builder & Page Builder**: We made it easier for the clients to fill the app with content and change the looks of it. We were inspired by softwares such as Wordpress & wix.com.
By this point, we had over 50 clients across the country, and we were exceptionally confident that this was going to solve the problems we faced with V1.

Unfortunately, we were too optimistic.

**What Happened**: Even though the app now has content, the variety of content was insufficent. Take the Arts Undergraduate Society for example, it has about 10-15 affiliated Facebook pages alone. Syncing one page per app was not enough. As a consequence, since students still had to check other sources of information to stay informed, people quickly ditched the app.

It didn’t take us long to realize that once again, we had a terrible product. 

I remember that moment very clearly; it made me question a lot of things. It became very easy to blame the faults of the product on the *laziness* of the customers or the *incompetence* of the users. I even wrote down in my book of reflections that *“In a perfect world, if our customers filled the app with content and that our users were more patient, the app would fulfill its original intention.”*

*“In a perfect world”*

That’s where we made our mistake.

We were designing products based on our optimism and assumptions rather than evidence. We *assumed* our customers were going to put content on the app even though we *knew* that they were incredibly busy. We *assumed* users would be generous and forgiving even though we *knew* that there was only one chance to make a first impression. It is in-fact very easy to make the same mistake twice if you are not paying attention to why it happened the first time.

With this new epiphany, we came up with **V3**.

The new version of our apps allows the integration of multiple information feeds so that the app is never empty. Users are now able to save the announcements that matter to them and delete the ones that are irrelevant. Furthermore, to incentivize engagement, we are going to release an exclusive coupon every day from our external partners to reward our users for staying informed.
