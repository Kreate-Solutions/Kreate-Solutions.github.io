## How many stations did your TV get when you were 6?

---

My parents didn’t buy cable, so ours had 4 channels, 5 if the weather was good and if we set the wire-hanger antenna up just right.

Those stations are not any better or any worse today, but back then I didn’t have a choice but to watch them. I’d watch the nightly news, I’d watch sitcoms; I once sat through the entire 40-minute infomercial for Ron Popeil’s portable rotisserie. Getting Hockey Night in Canada on CBC or an old action movie on Saturday nights was a treat worth waiting 6 days for.

Now, I go home every night to over 100 HD cable channels, cycle through them twice and decide there is nothing good on. Then I jump back on my laptop, which I had already been staring at all day while at work.

As human beings, we crave more of what we like. Ten years ago, a can of Coke had 36 grams of sugar. Today, the same can contains 40 grams of the white stuff. Our sensitivity has decreased over time, so the only way manufacturers can keep us hooked is to make things ever sweeter.

As human beings, we also crave what’s new and different. Beer makers are getting worried that our sweet tooth will turn us off of their products. A solution they’ve embraced is to do the opposite, and make bitter-er brews. Next time you’re in a bar, ask about the variety of IPAs and imperial stouts on tap. Our fathers’ generation would switch between, on average, 3 brands of beer. Now we walk down the grocery aisle and pick from over 30. It comes down to dopamine – the chemical in our brains that pushes us to seek out and consume experiences.

But what’s true for sugar and beer isn’t so for our time spent on the internet. While too many sweet will sour our mouths and too many brews will make us sick, the dopamine loop created by texting, using social media or web search can never be satiated.

> It leaves us wanting more, more; more.

Have you read something on your phone today? Are you reading this on your phone right now? There’s a [56% chance](http://newstex.com/2014/05/14/more-than-half-of-digital-content-now-consumed-on-mobile-devices/) you actually are.

Around 350,000 new human beings are born each day, so it is normal to see more people consuming content on the internet. But the number of people using only their desktop computers has shrunk by 45% in the past year, while the number of smartphone-only users increased by 36% in the same time span.

When we moved into our new office, we had an artist come in and do a mural (picture). Our CEO Tom asked what the mural means to me. This is what I came up with:

> Consider this: in your hand is a plastic box which grants you access to every single idea ever conceived by mankind. *Choose wisely*.

Older generations could say we’re lucky, that we’re entitled, that we don’t do enough, or that we complain too much. They are partially right; we truly are lucky to be born into a more modern, generally better world. There’s certainly less to complain about now than ever before in the history of mankind, as least when it comes to satisfying our basic needs. But they were just as lucky to grow up in a society without the entertainments that causes so much distraction and provides so many incentives to sit down and do nothing for hours on end. If your only choices as a child were to go outside and play, to stay in and read a book, or just to lie down, look at the ceiling and daydream for a while, that’s not so bad, is it?

It’s not that simple anymore.

Our mobile phones allow us to do whatever we want, wherever we want, whenever we want, so it’s not particularly surprising that we all end up reading thoughts from shower philosophers and looking at cats on Reddit instead of getting informed of dry, impersonal but ultimately important stuff like local politics or community news.

With Facebook set to [cap the organic reach of most pages to 1-2%](http://leaderswest.com/2014/03/27/facebook-to-limit-page-reach-to-1-2/), a local newspaper will be lucky to reach a
dozen of its current 1000 Facebook fans, even if their readers really should know
what is happening down at City Hall.

Most of us at the office have been involved in student organizations and seen things
like a 8 people showing up to an important council vote, or a $40 000 event
attracting 6 visitors. Sending out event invites over social media is like throwing
a pie at the wall and hoping it sticks.

Ultimately, what we are trying to do at Kreate is to use technology to help each other get back in touch with the things we need to care about. By helping schools and non-profits streamline the process of getting information to those who deserve to know, you'll spend more time reading things from people you'd usually ignore.

If we can do that, then we'll have done a world of good.
