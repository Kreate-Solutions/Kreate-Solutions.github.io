###Maybe midterms are coming up, maybe you have research for a few papers that you just can’t seem to dig into. Don’t fire up Youtube or that Playstation just yet…

Do you notice yourself breathing right now? Probably not until I reminded you. Yet it’s the most important thing that you could be doing. For humans, oxygen is the oasis of life. You can theoretically stay alive up to two months without food and three weeks without water*, but don’t breathe for 3 minutes and you are flirting with permanent brain damage, or worse.

Which brings us to carbon monoxide, the silent killer. We all know about the dangers of leaving a car running in a closed garage, but do you know why CO can knock you out in a few breaths and take your life in 20 minutes or less? As it turns out, it’s all about molecules within our red blood cells. Even though it is the job of the hemoglobin molecules to carry oxygen from our lungs to our brains and beyond, they’d rather bond with the toxic carbon monoxide molecules.

Your blood cells prefer to carry poison than oxygen through your veins by a factor of 230-to-1*. If what you are taking in is 99% air and 1% carbon monoxide, you’ll be dead within minutes. It’s a bit shocking when you put it that way, knowing that your body would much rather kill itself even when provided with an ample supply of what it needs. But you wouldn’t necessarily blame it for this failing. More likely, you’d simply take stock of the dangers, avoid putting yourself in situations where it could become a problem, and use tools like CO detectors (or oxygen masks, if you are a first responder) to mitigate the risks. The human body is an amazing machine with just a few deficiencies. And the same goes for the human mind.

We like to procrastinate because our attention is more easily captivated by entertainment, trivial information, and activities where failure don’t result in a stain on our GPAs.

*It’s normal.*

*You’re not lazy.*

*You’re not unmotivated.*

You just have a little bit too much going on around you. Go somewhere quiet. Turn off your phone. Listen to one song on repeat*, if at all.

Notice yourself breathing.

You can do this. This is what you’re meant to do.

I believe in you.
