# *"So how is everything with the business?"*

---

If you are reading this right now, you’ve probably asked me this question before (even if you think you haven’t). I get asked this question about 12 times a day, from my parents, my investors, my advisers, my friends, my friends’ parents, my accountant, and my grandparents, who still have absolutely no idea what a “smartphone” is, let alone an "app."

If you pay attention to my answer, which I know all of you do, it usually starts with me pausing for half a second, tilting my head up a little, and then saying, “Well…”

After that, I typically answer your question in about a sentence or two, at which point I know I have already completely lost your attention. Today, I am going to decipher every rehearsed step I go through in those few seconds after you ask me that question. Here it goes:

*Action: Pausing for half a second.*

*My train of thought:* “Seriously? This is the nth time I’ve heard this question today. I even got a haircut, and you didn’t notice? Don’t lose it Tom, don’t you dare lose it.”

*Action: Tilt my head up a little.*

*Meaning: “Still trying to not lose it.”*

*Action: “Well…”*

*Meaning:* At this moment, hundreds of thoughts are passing through my head: my product, my balance sheet, my customers, my co-workers, my mission, another letter from Revenue Quebec asking for money, the Nigerian Prince who somehow got my email address and is begging me to keep nine million dollars for him while he finds another person to scam. It’s like watching my entire life flash before my eyes. (Seriously, I cannot find a better metaphor).

It is nearly impossible to reduce everything that is going on in my head, let alone the entire business, into two sentences that would make any meaningful sense to you. Besides, even if I could reduce it into one sentence or less, I am not sure if you are actually listening. We are becoming masters of small-talk in a world where a meaningless conversation is often preferable to a simple smile and, “Hello.” Not that I mind, I’ll still give you my undivided attention.

“How is everything going with your business” is my least favourite question to answer because it forces me to think hard about everything that is going on, but it’s also my favourite for the exact same reason. This question forces me to be honest with myself about our current state of affairs - whether positive or negative. One of the most difficult things to accomplish in business is maintaining a sober grasp of what’s going on, and not becoming too attached to our own wishful thinking. It’s very easy to overemphasize an achievement or a failure when it’s not put in perspective with the big picture. This question, as much I dread it, brings me to reality and forces me to put everything in perspective. This question also reminds me that regardless of the many obstacles that are in front of us, we still have a destination. We may not necessarily know how to get there, but without a shadow of a doubt, we know where to go. As strange as this may sound, it is possible to forget why I am doing this, and it can happen somewhere between bug fixes and bookkeeping. Without putting things in perspective, we can lose ourselves in the labyrinth of details.

So the next time you ask me this question, know that I am truly grateful. More importantly, no matter the answer I give you, short or wordy, know that it is genuine. However, if you choose to ask me this question when both of us are standing outside in a blizzard, where the wind chill is comparable to the temperature on Mars, just know that a simple smile and hello would have been alright :)
