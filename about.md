From smoke signals to the telegraph to the modern smartphone, a means of
communication is only as helpful as the message it is being used to convey. Spending over 5 hours a day consuming content about anything and
everything from a little box in our hands has made our generation
disengaged from education, politics and other causes that matter. We are a group of young people with a plan for turning a world of
“likes” and “shares” into one which better fosters active participation.
